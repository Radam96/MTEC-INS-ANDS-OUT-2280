                       Three Artists


1) Graffiti Research Lab – LASER Tag Laser video-projection graffiti
- I chose this one becuase it caught my eye first when it said video projection, only because i like stuff like that.
  Also this project looks pretty cool its resembles one of our first projects we did in class with the line drawing in our processing sketches. 
   So i would assume that a concept of line dragged because you have to hold the laser so you can draw and not just flash it at the building. and i would
   guess that on the building there's like a sensor somewhere.


2) Aussie50 – Self Destroying Laundry Machine Epic A laundry machine that destroys itself
- I literally laughed watching this video to the end. The only thing i can assume what happened was what he threw in the machine caused some sort of reaction
  with the washing machine and caused it to spazz out. Also at the bottom of the machine had a device, in which the user may have set a timer. there might have also 
 been a delay time, you can tell it increases every second or other.

3 )Barbican - Rain Room
- This room looks very intresting at first if i was walking i would be contimplating whether or not if i were to get wet walking through. We can see 
  that this a 3d concept with a combination of Video projection and proper camera angling. Illusions like that is very fascinating to me. I'm unsure about the coding, but i assume it's
 a time coding with certain videos.
