Final Project

Hello class my name is Riyad Adam and this is my final project. I tried to implement the two axis arm robot we been doing in class for a purpose . My first idea was to do a handshake with another partner but everyone else had other plans so I was like okay next . I don’t know where I got the current idea but I thought of attaching a laser to my robotic arm so when an object falls the laser comes on and scans the area. Sadly that idea got derailed it has a similar concept right now but I think my code was backwards . I first had to think how to make a object fall and it to head it so that seemed like a task. So I coded the arm grasp thing that when it’s at 180 degrees open it’s eligible to grab something and now that it’s gripped laser comes on. But then Dimple gave me idea of attaching a sensor so when it detects an object approaching the claw opens , so we tried that using a light photocell which only detects light. We found struggles because the sensor would spit out data of 0-5 in the serial monitor but when I flash my phone light it increases to 100 and above and that was confusing. I’m not 100% sure that this project is complete but as of right now what works is all my parts I implanted which includes my servos, my arm , sensor , and laser . It’s not doing what I intended but it has the idea of open when an object is near and my kepPressed code controls the laser . It sucks that I wasn’t able to finish it , maybe I was being a little too complicated but I would like to thank Professor Grayson and our class Clt Dimple for the help throughout the semester, they opened a whole new world of coding and emerging media to me . Also to my fellow classmates who helped me along the way during the semester . Thank you once again !
